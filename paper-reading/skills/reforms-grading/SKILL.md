# REFORMS Grading

## Orchestration Pattern

1. Fetch the paper; stop on `not_found`.
2. Run `study-design-tool-gate` and write its verdict to
   `01-study-design-tool-gate.json`.
3. If it selects a clinical/review instrument, stop and name that tool. If it
   selects `engineering-config-grading` or returns `not_applicable`, proceed.
4. Run `engineering-config-grading`, using that tool name when the gate
   returned `not_applicable`, and write `02-engineering-config-grading.json`.

Record `proposal_sop: true`. Each justification must state what complete
reporting would look like before grading the paper. Report the gate verdict,
complete/partial/none counts, every `none` item, the unverified-proposal
caveat, and both paths.
