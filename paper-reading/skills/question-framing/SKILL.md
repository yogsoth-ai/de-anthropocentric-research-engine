name: question-framing
description: Fill a slot-based question-framing schema (PICO, PECO, or SPIDER) from a paper's stated research question. Use this whenever the user wants a paper's research question structured into one of these standard clinical/qualitative-research question frames; this frames what question is being asked, it does not read or evaluate the paper's content otherwise.

# Question Framing

Slot-filling into PICO/PECO/SPIDER, parameterized on which schema — defines the question being asked, doesn't evaluate paper content.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via spawn-agent skill.

## Not the same as research-question-appraisal

This SOP fills slots to describe what question is asked. `research-question-appraisal` (FINER) instead judges whether a research question is good — different structure, different SOP, not a parameterization of this one (see graph correction M15).
