name: rationale-selection
description: Select the minimal set of 1-3 verbatim sentences from a candidate paper/abstract sufficient to entail or refute an atomic claim (SciFact's rationale-selection step). Use this after claim-writing has produced an atomic claim, as the evidence-gathering step before claim-label-prediction; an empty rationale set is a valid outcome, not an error.

# Rationale Selection

Selects minimal evidentiary sentence set for a claim — middle step of the SciFact 3-chain, added to close coverage-audit finding S7 (the original graph jumped straight from claim-writing to a three-way label judgment with no evidence-selection step, even though the tag table's own stated output anchor explicitly requires rationale sentences alongside the label).

## Execution
