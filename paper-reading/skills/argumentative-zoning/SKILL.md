# Argumentative Zoning

## Orchestration Pattern

1. Fetch the paper; stop on `not_found`.
2. Segment the requested scope with sentence granularity and preserve
   `{line, start, end}` offsets. Write `01-unit-segmentation.json`.
3. Classify every unit with `label_set: argumentative-zoning`,
   `hierarchy_toggle: false`, and `output_type: single_label`. Write
   `02-unit-classification.json`.

Use exactly AIM, BACKGROUND, OWN, CONTRAST, BASIS, TEXTUAL, and OTHER. Every
sentence receives one label; use OTHER rather than skipping an uncertain
unit. Narrow scopes are valid but not distributionally comparable to a
full-text run.

Report scope, sentence count, zone counts, empty zones, and both paths.
