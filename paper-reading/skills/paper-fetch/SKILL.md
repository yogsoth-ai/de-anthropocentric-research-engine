description: Retrieve one specified academic paper (by title, arXiv ID, DOI, URL, or a local .md/.txt/.pdf path the caller already has) and land it on disk as source.md plus a source.meta.json carrying a line-number section index. Checks context/papers/ for an existing copy first; local files and direct PDF URLs are read directly with no search at all, while other references use alphaxiv, Semantic Scholar routing, then bioRxiv/medRxiv. Use this as the mandatory first step whenever any other paper-reading SOP in this package needs the actual text of a paper — it is the sole entry point of the pipeline and every downstream SOP reads the files it lands, so do not bypass it even when the caller already has the file. If it returns not_found, halt immediately; do not fabricate content or guess at the paper's likely contents.

# Paper Fetch

If the caller already has the paper — a local `.md`/`.txt`/`.pdf` path, or a direct
HTTP(S) PDF URL (path ends in `.pdf`, ignoring query and fragment) — read it
directly before considering any search route. Record `source_channel` as
`local_file`, `local_pdf`, or `direct_pdf`. If the read fails, return `not_found`
and do not fall back to alphaxiv, Semantic Scholar, bioRxiv, or medRxiv.

The pipeline's sole entry point: retrieves a paper and lands it on disk. It checks
the cache first, reads already-identified sources (local files, direct PDF URLs)
with no search at all, and otherwise uses the fixed fallback (alphaxiv → Semantic
Scholar routing → bioRxiv/medRxiv → not_found).
Decoupled from `literature-engine`'s `literature-research`/`literature-search`/
`literature-overview` — this SOP holds its own retrieval calls rather than delegating.

## Why an already-supplied file still enters through this SOP

Skipping straight to a reading SOP with the caller's own path looks like it saves
a step, but 13 downstream SOPs take `meta_path` and read only section line ranges
(`star-awarding` reads method + results; `first-pass-skim`'s "headings only, never
bodies" constraint holds *because* it is handed shallow ranges). A bare path
carries no index, and a bare `.pdf` carries no extracted text at all.

So the thing to skip is the **four-channel search**, not the landing and indexing.
That is what Step 1 does: no network lookup, same landing step, same output
contract. Tactics keep passing `paper_ref` through unchanged and never learn there
was a new input form.

## Landed layout

```
context/papers/<timestamp>-<title-slug>/
  source.md            the paper, as fetched
  source.meta.json     metadata + line-number section index
```

All landed filenames are lowercase. `<title-slug>` is lowercased, non-alphanumerics collapsed to hyphens, Windows-illegal characters (`: * ? " < > |`) stripped, truncated to 60 chars against path-length limits.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via spawn-agent skill.

## Why Subagent

Multi-step retrieval with direct-PDF handling and domain-inference judgment calls
(is a Semantic-Scholar miss a bio signal or a "just not indexed anywhere" signal?)
benefits from a dedicated context that can hold the whole decision tree without the
noise of whatever task will consume its output next.

## Why it lands files instead of returning text

A paper runs 60-80k tokens. Returning it as `full_text` means every downstream SOP pays that cost again, and the orchestrating tactic carries it in its own window on top. Landing it once and returning a path means: re-reading the same paper across tactics costs one cache check rather than one fetch; SOPs that need only part of the paper read only that part; the orchestrator holds paths, not text.

## Why a section index, not pre-cut slices

`source.meta.json` records where each section *is* (line ranges) rather than shipping pre-cut slices. Slicing is a per-consumer concern — `unit-segmentation` already declares `scope: full_text | abstract | intro_only`, `research-question-appraisal` wants intro + abstract, `engineering-config-grading` wants method + experiments + appendix. Pre-cutting would mean this SOP has to know every downstream SOP's definition of "the part I need", and would need editing every time one is added. An index is neutral: consumers do their own offset reads against `source.md`.

This also makes `first-pass-skim`'s defining constraint (skim headings and captions, never section bodies) hold by construction rather than by self-restraint — it is handed line ranges for the shallow parts only.

## Cache lookup is by identifier, not directory name

Directories are named `<timestamp>-<title-slug>`, but `paper_ref` may arrive as an arXiv ID, a DOI, a URL, a local file path, or a title, and matching an arXiv ID against a title-derived directory name fails. So the lookup scans `context/papers/*/source.meta.json` and matches on `identifier` or `title_slug` — both are recorded precisely so any form of `paper_ref` resolves. For a local file, `identifier` is its absolute path, so re-running a tactic on the same file is a cache hit rather than a second copy.

Matching tolerates case and punctuation differences in titles but is deliberately not fuzzy: a missed cache hit costs one redundant fetch, while a false hit silently reads the wrong paper for the rest of the pipeline.

## Why Not Built on literature-engine

`literature-overview`/`literature-search`/`literature-research` already have an alphaxiv-primary/SS-supplementary pattern, but none has a bioRxiv/medRxiv branch or an explicit "can't retrieve → halt" contract, and this package is deliberately decoupled from that pipeline's scope (see `context/2026-08-07-15-15-paper-fetch-sop-design.md` and spec §9). Do not refactor this SOP to import those skills later without revisiting that decision explicitly.

## Full design reference

`context/2026-08-07-15-15-paper-fetch-sop-design.md` — the channel decision-flow rationale (why alphaxiv's coverage list is the domain signal, why an SS miss still routes to bio rather than dead-ending). The landing / index / cache design is in `context/2026-08-07-23-01-sop-io-contract-simulation.md` §4, option C.
