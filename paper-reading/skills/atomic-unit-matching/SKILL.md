description: Judge, per atomic content unit, whether a target text (summary, abstract, or other candidate text) contains it — binary present/absent (ACU) or ternary support/partial_support/not_support (Nugget), per caller's value domain. Use this after atomic-unit-writing has produced the reference units, as the matching step before recall aggregation.
