# Second Pass Grasp

Keshav's second pass: full read, proofs/derivations deferred, output is accumulated prose understanding (not a structured artifact — this is the one method in this package's whole method set that deliberately does not produce a persisted structured object).

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via spawn-agent skill.

## Why Subagent

Full-text reading toward a genuine "could explain this to a colleague" understanding benefits from an uninterrupted context, distinct from the shallow first pass and the exhaustive third pass.

## Do not port v1's bundle schema here

An earlier version of this package (`staged/wechat-article-v1/skills/second-pass-grasp/`) produced a `draft_bundle` + `uncertain_fields` structure for its own WeChat-article pipeline. That was correct for v1's purpose but is NOT Keshav's original second pass — this v2 SOP's output is prose, per the graph's explicit correction (`context/2026-08-07-13-42-sop-pipeline-graph.html`, node `second-pass-grasp`, "S2修订"). Do not reintroduce the bundle schema here.
