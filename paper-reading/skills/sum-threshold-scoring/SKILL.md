description: Sum NOS's item-level stars and bucket into good (≥7)/fair (4-6)/poor (≤3) — a fixed threshold lookup, structurally distinct from worst-case-lookup's take-the-worst-value approach. Use this after star-awarding has produced the per-item stars; this is NOS's terminal step.

# Sum Threshold Scoring

Sum-then-bucket, NOS's own aggregation shape — deliberately kept separate from worst-case-lookup since NOS sums rather than takes a worst-case value (structurally different aggregation, not a value-domain variant of the same algorithm).

## Execution
