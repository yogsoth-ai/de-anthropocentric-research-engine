# Research Question Appraisal

FINER: five independent judgments on the paper's stated research question (not on its execution or results). Structurally closer to a quality-appraisal checklist than to slot-filling — do not merge with question-framing (graph correction M15: PICO/PECO/SPIDER fill slots, FINER judges).

## Execution
