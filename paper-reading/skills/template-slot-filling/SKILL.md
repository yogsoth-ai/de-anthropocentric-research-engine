description: Fill a paper's reported values into an already-given comparison-template attribute schema (e.g. Task/Dataset/Metric/Value) — the executable half of ORKG's comparison-template method. Use this when a template's attribute schema is already fixed and you need one paper's row filled in; this does NOT build new templates (that half is a human-curator task, out of scope).

# Template Slot Filling

Fills a paper's values into a pre-given attribute template (ORKG comparison-template's executable half). Building the template itself is excluded — documented as a human-curator task, not an LLM-executable SOP.
