# ACU / Nugget Recall

## Orchestration Pattern

1. Require `target_summary`; never generate the scored summary inside this
   tactic.
2. Fetch the paper and create `acu-nugget-recall/`.
3. Extract units before exposing the summary to the unit-writing step. ACU
   uses extracted/binary units; Nugget uses authored, importance-tagged units.
4. Match all units against `target_summary` in one call.
5. Aggregate the results and write `03-recall-aggregate.json`.

Write `01-atomic-unit-writing.json`, `02-atomic-unit-matching.json`, and
`03-recall-aggregate.json`. Record the summary source. Report every unmatched
unit, not just the score. For a single-summary Nugget run, carry the method's
weak per-topic reliability caveat alongside the number.
