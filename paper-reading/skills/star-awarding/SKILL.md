description: Award NOS's (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) stars item-by-item across Selection (up to 4), Comparability (up to 2), and Outcome/Exposure (up to 3) — a binary award-or-not action per item, distinct from a 5-value signalling judgment. Use this after study-design-tool-gate has dispatched to NOS, as the first step before sum-threshold-scoring.

# Star Awarding

NOS's item-by-item star awarding — binary per item, not a signalling-question judgment. Added per coverage-audit M8: the original graph had NOS's stars appearing already-summed at an aggregation node, with no node actually doing the item-level awarding those sums depend on.
