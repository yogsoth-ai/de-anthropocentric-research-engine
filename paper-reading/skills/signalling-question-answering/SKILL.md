# Signalling Question Answering

Raw per-domain 5-value signalling answers for RoB2/ROBINS-I/QUADAS-2. First of two algorithmic levels these tools require — see domain-level-judgment for the second.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via spawn-agent skill.

## Scope Note (per coverage-audit M8)

NOS's star-awarding and AMSTAR-2's checklist items are NOT this SOP's concern — an earlier graph draft conflated "answer a domain question" with "award a star" and "check a checklist item," but these are three structurally different actions (5-value signalling judgment vs. binary star-or-not vs. checklist Yes/No/Partial). Keep this SOP scoped to exactly RoB2/ROBINS-I/QUADAS-2's signalling questions.
