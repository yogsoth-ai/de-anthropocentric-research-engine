# 🧠 DARE — De-Anthropocentric Research Engine

*🚧 Personal side project. Actively under development.*

DARE is not a tool that helps you do research. It *is* the researcher. You set the direction — DARE searches, reads, discovers gaps, generates ideas, designs experiments, and executes them on GPUs. Autonomously. Iteratively. Without asking for permission.

---

## ⚡ What It Does

- 📚 **Autonomous literature survey** — searches Google Scholar, downloads full papers (not just abstracts), reads them cover-to-cover with a three-pass protocol
- 🔍 **Gap discovery** — identifies what the field is missing, not what you tell it to find
- 💡 **Idea generation** — 31 ideation methods across 5 categories (SCAMPER, component surgery, cross-domain, perspective forcing, structural deconstruction), filtered by MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithm
- ⚔️ **Adversarial debate** — Proposer-Critic-Judge architecture validates every gap, insight, and idea through structured 4+3 round debates
- 🔬 **INSIGHT pipeline** — 7-step deep analysis (root-cause → stakeholder → tension → HMW → abstraction → assumption → validation)
- 🔄 **Self-review loop** — an independent AI process reviews all outputs, scores them, and selectively re-runs weak stages
- 📏 **Research depth enforcement** — quantitative budget floors (S/M/L topic tiers), state ledgers, budget gates, and adversarial completeness probes ensure the AI cannot take shortcuts or produce shallow results
- 🌍 **Forced cross-domain discovery** — before ideation, mandatory search across 3+ unrelated domains (biology, physics, economics, etc.) to fuel cross-domain collision methods
- 🧪 **Experiment design & execution** — designs experiments and runs them on remote GPU pods, autonomously
- 🧬 **Method evolution** (planned) — AlphaEvolve-inspired evolutionary improvement of DARE's own methods (mutation + crossover + Elo ranking). Core tools implemented, full loop coming in v3.2+
- 🌐 **Deep reference exploration** — traces citation graphs via Semantic Scholar
- 💾 **Full-text caching** — every paper and web page converted to markdown, cached locally
- 🚀 **Git-based context transfer** — research context pushed to GitHub, cloned on remote GPU pod, executed by a fresh AI instance

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Active development continues. Near-term priorities:

- **🔬 Search pipeline overhaul** — major refactor of `dare-web` and `dare-scholar` search flows to better integrate with AlphaXiv MCP and upcoming Perplexity MCP, reducing redundancy and improving retrieval quality
- **🧬 Method-evolve full loop (v3.2+)** — AlphaEvolve-inspired evolutionary improvement of DARE's own research methods. Core tools (mutate, crossover, evaluate) implemented; full autonomous Elo-tournament loop next
- **📝 Paper-writing implementation (v3.1+)** — automated academic paper composition from research outputs. Strategy interface defined, implementation pending
- **🔗 GitHub MCP integration** — native GitHub MCP adapter for issue tracking, PR-driven experiment workflows, and automated result reporting
- **🌐 Perplexity MCP adapter** — leverage Perplexity's search-augmented generation as an additional web research backend

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### 🤔 Why "De-Anthropocentric"?

The bottleneck in modern research is not data or compute — it's the human in the loop. Every existing "AI research assistant" still requires a human to decide what to search, what to read, which gaps matter, and which ideas are worth pursuing. DARE removes this bottleneck entirely. The human provides only the initial direction; everything after that is autonomous.

This isn't about replacing researchers — it's about creating a parallel research capacity that operates on timescales and breadths impossible for any individual.

### 🎖️ The Military Metaphor: Four-Layer Command Structure

DARE's architecture follows a military command hierarchy — not because research is war, but because the decomposition pattern is remarkably effective:

```bash
General (Meta-Strategy)  →  "Take that hill"         →  WHAT to research
Colonel (Strategy)       →  "Flank from the east"    →  WHEN and WHY
Captain (Tactic)         →  "Squad A cover, B move"  →  HOW to combine
Sergeant (SOP)           →  "Fire, reload, advance"  →  HOW to execute
```

Each layer has a single concern and calls only the layer directly below it. A Strategy never touches MCP tools directly; a Tactic never decides research direction. This strict layering means every component is independently testable, replaceable, and composable.

### 🤖 Micro-Agent Paradigm: Every Tool Thinks

Traditional MCP tools are dumb functions — they take input, return output, no reasoning involved. DARE's `dare-agents` tools are fundamentally different. Each of the 49 tools is a **single-responsibility LLM micro-agent** with its own system prompt, personality, and reasoning chain.

When DARE runs "root-cause-drilling", it's not calling a template — it's spawning an AI agent whose entire existence is devoted to drilling from surface symptoms to root causes. When "debate-critic" runs, it genuinely tries to destroy the idea it's reviewing. This is what makes DARE's outputs qualitatively different from prompt-chaining systems.

Built on [`pi-ai`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — a lightweight framework for building LLM-powered tools as MCP servers.

### ⚔️ Adversarial Validation: Ideas Must Survive Attack

Every significant output in DARE goes through adversarial debate before being accepted. The Proposer-Critic-Judge architecture isn't decoration — it's the core quality mechanism:

1. A **Proposer** presents the gap/insight/idea
2. A **Critic** attacks it from every angle (4 rounds of critique)
3. A **Defender** responds to each attack (3 rounds of defense)
4. A **Judge** evaluates the exchange and scores the result

Ideas that survive this gauntlet are genuinely robust. Ideas that don't are discarded or refined. No hand-waving, no "sounds good to me."

### 🎲 Quality × Diversity: Not Just Good Ideas, Different Ideas

Most AI systems optimize for a single quality metric — they'll give you 10 variations of the same good idea. DARE uses **MAP-Elites**, a quality-diversity algorithm that maintains a population of ideas spanning multiple dimensions of variation. The result: you get the *best* idea in each *niche*, not 10 copies of the same insight.

### 📏 Research Depth & Breadth Enforcement

AI agents naturally take the path of least resistance — searching a handful of papers and declaring victory. DARE embeds hard enforcement mechanisms directly into every skill to prevent this:

- **Research Budget**: Every strategy declares quantitative floors with three topic-size tiers (Small / Medium / Large). A literature survey on a Medium topic *must* fetch 40+ papers and 50+ web pages.
- **State Ledger**: A progress table printed before every iteration — the AI cannot lose track of where it stands.
- **Budget Gate**: A `<HARD-GATE>` that blocks the strategy from exiting its loop until 80% of the budget is met. The AI *cannot* stop early no matter how "satisfied" it feels.
- **Adversarial Completeness Probe**: After the budget is met, a qualitative self-check probes for blind spots (missing sub-areas, unchecked citations, unexplored perspectives). Up to 2 extra iterations if gaps are found.
- **Yield Reports**: Every tactic prints execution metrics (papers fetched, ideas generated, methods used) that feed the calling strategy's ledger.
- **Cross-Domain Discovery**: Before any ideation method runs, a mandatory phase searches 3+ unrelated domains for analogical inspiration — because the best ideas come from unexpected collisions.

## 🏗️ Architecture (v3.0)

Four-layer skill hierarchy where each layer calls only the layer below:

```bash
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  META-STRATEGY (/dare)                                        │

├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  STRATEGY (8)                                                 │
│  intake, lit-survey, gap-analysis, insight, ideation,         │
│  round, paper-writing, method-evolve                          │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TACTIC (15)                                                  │
│  academic-research, web-research, insight, multiagent-debate, │
│  review, idea-generation, idea-augmentation, scamper,         │
│  component-surgery, cross-domain-collision, and more          │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SOP (60)                                                     │
│  Single-responsibility wrappers around dare-agents tools      │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TOOL LAYER (MCP servers — atomic operations)                 │
│  dare-agents, dare-scholar, dare-web, apify, brave, runpod    │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Meta-Strategy** = WHAT to research (entry point, pipeline orchestration)
- **Strategy** = WHEN and WHY (iteration loops, state management, stopping conditions)
- **Tactic** = HOW to combine (orchestrates multiple SOPs into coherent workflows)
- **SOP** = HOW to execute (single dare-agents tool wrapper with protocol)
- **Tool** = WHAT to do (atomic MCP operations)
