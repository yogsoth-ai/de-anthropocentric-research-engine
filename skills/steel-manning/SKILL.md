# Steel-Manning

Adversarial verification of convergence decisions. This campaign subjects winners, criteria, and rejected alternatives to rigorous challenge — ensuring that final decisions survive the strongest possible counter-arguments rather than merely the weakest objections.

The campaign deploys four complementary attack vectors: resurrecting rejected candidates to test whether elimination was justified, stress-testing winners to find hidden weaknesses, interrogating the criteria framework itself, and simulating stakeholder objections for political feasibility.

## Strategy Routing

| Signal | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| resurrect rejected candidates / give losers a fair hearing | resurrection-advocacy |
| stress-test the winner / find weaknesses in top pick | winner-stress-testing |
| challenge the criteria themselves / meta-level questioning | criteria-interrogation |
| simulate stakeholder objections / political feasibility | stakeholder-objection-simulation |
| construct strongest counter-argument / dialectical challenge | counter-thesis-construction |

## Manifest

## Budget Table (M Tier)

| Metric | Minimum |
|--------|---------|
| Attack perspectives | >= 3 distinct angles |
| Debate rounds | >= 2 per contested decision |
| Assumptions challenged | >= 5 per winner |
| Final verdict | Explicit ACCEPT / REJECT / REVISE with evidence |

## MCP Tools

- `mcp__wiki-vault__vault_search` — retrieve prior decisions and context
- `mcp__wiki-vault__vault_query_graph` — trace dependency chains for impact analysis
- `mcp__wiki-vault__vault_add_edge` — record challenge relationships

## Context Management

The campaign maintains a **Challenge Ledger** tracking:
- Which decisions have been challenged
- Attack vectors applied to each
- Verdicts rendered and their conditions
- Surviving concerns requiring monitoring

State is passed between strategies via the ledger. Each strategy updates it upon completion.

## Available Strategies

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| Strategy | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| counter-thesis-construction | Construct the strongest possible counter-argument to the convergence decision using Dialectical Inquiry and Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis methods. |
| criteria-interrogation | Challenge the evaluation criteria themselves using Assumption-based Planning, Critical Systems Heuristics, and Boundary Critique to ensure the framework is sound. |
| resurrection-advocacy | Argue for rejected candidates using Devil's Advocacy, Dialectical Inquiry, and Adversarial Collaboration to ensure elimination was justified. |
| stakeholder-objection-simulation | Simulate stakeholder objections through role-play and political feasibility analysis to test whether the decision survives real-world opposition. |
| winner-stress-testing | Stress-test the winning candidate using Pre-mortem, Red Teaming, and Failure Mode Analysis to expose hidden weaknesses before commitment. |

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| context-checkpoint | Append research process and results to the current Phase's context file. Each append MUST contain >=500 lines of markdown covering both process and results. Use this skill at plan-designated checkpoint points — typically after each strategy completes or at key decision nodes within a research Phase. |
| context-init | Create a new context file for a research Phase. Called once at Phase start to initialize the file that subsequent context-checkpoint calls will append to. Use this skill whenever a new research Phase begins and a fresh context file is needed. |
| convergence-multi-stakeholder-simulation | Simulates diverse stakeholder perspectives and their strongest objections/support arguments. Shared across steel-manning and consensus campaigns. |
| convergence-saturation-detection | Determines when to stop iterating — coverage threshold met or marginal returns diminishing. Shared across all campaigns. |
| convergence-sensitivity-analysis | Tests conclusion robustness by perturbing parameters and observing rank changes. Shared across scoring, portfolio, and steel-manning campaigns. |
