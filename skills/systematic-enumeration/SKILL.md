## Strategy Routing

| Strategy | Signal Keywords |
|----------|----------------|
| benchmark-sweep | benchmark, state-of-the-art, survey, catalog, inventory, known solutions |
| method-problem-matrix | matrix, crossing, intersection, method×problem, unexplored combinations |
| ablation-brainstorm | ablation, remove, component, dependency, what-if-removed |
| failure-taxonomy | failure, fault, error, breakdown, failure mode, robustness |
| factorial-ideation | factor, level, DOE, design of experiments, combination, factorial |

| method-problem-crossing | Build method×problem cross-reference matrix |
| intersection-evaluation | Evaluate exploration status of each matrix cell |
| ablation-execution | Remove components one by one, record responses |
| dependency-identification | Identify critical dependencies from ablation results |
| failure-mode-cataloging | Systematically catalog failure modes |

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Server | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| brave_web_search | brave-search | General web search for methods and examples |
| brave_llm_context | brave-search | Deep content extraction from web pages |
| apify/rag-web-browser | apify | Full page scraping for detailed content |

| citations | semantic-scholar | Trace citation networks |

## Context Management

- Each strategy tracks its own budget via State Ledger
- Strategies MUST NOT exceed allocated budget
- Campaign monitors cumulative spend across all strategies
- If a strategy exhausts budget before meeting yield, escalate to campaign level for reallocation
- Prefer paper-overview over paper-research for initial exploration (lower cost)

## Available Strategies

| Strategy | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| ablation-brainstorm | Remove components one by one, observe system changes to reveal hidden dependencies and generate ideas from structural gaps. |
| benchmark-sweep | Systematically scan all known solutions, identify gaps in coverage and unexplored regions of the solution space. |
| factorial-ideation | DOE thinking: identify factors, define levels, and explore combinations to systematically cover the design space. |
| failure-taxonomy | Catalog all failure modes in a domain, classify them systematically, and generate targeted solutions for each failure type. |
| method-problem-matrix | Cross method×problem matrix, find unexplored intersections where known methods have not been applied to known problems. |

## Available Tactics

可选,无固定顺序;最终叶子终为 sop。

| Tactic | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| coverage-analysis | Systematic coverage evaluation pipeline — benchmark inventory, method-problem crossing, and intersection evaluation to map explored vs unexplored solution space. |
| creative-ideation-combination-mapping | Systematically enumerate parameter dimensions and generate viable combinations. Orchestrates parameter extraction → value enumeration → compatibility assessment → synthesis. |
| evaluation-filtering | Multi-dimensional evaluation and tiered filtering of generated ideas. Orchestrates novelty assessment → feasibility check → ranking → selection. |
| gap-driven-generation | Generate solutions targeting specific coverage gaps — detect gaps, generate failure-driven solutions, and design factor-level experiments. |

## Available SOPs

可选,无固定顺序;最终叶子终为 sop。

| SOP | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| context-checkpoint | Append research process and results to the current Phase's context file. Each append MUST contain >=500 lines of markdown covering both process and results. Use this skill at plan-designated checkpoint points — typically after each strategy completes or at key decision nodes within a research Phase. |
| context-init | Create a new context file for a research Phase. Called once at Phase start to initialize the file that subsequent context-checkpoint calls will append to. Use this skill whenever a new research Phase begins and a fresh context file is needed. |
| creative-ideation-novelty-scoring | Score ideas on novelty dimensions — structural distance from known solutions, conceptual surprise, domain-crossing depth. Produces ranked novelty assessment. |
| creative-ideation-saturation-detection | Determine when additional ideation yields diminishing returns. Analyzes latest idea batch against existing corpus to judge continue/near-saturation/saturated. |
| enumeration-synthesis | Synthesize all systematic enumeration outputs into a structured idea report with prioritized recommendations. |
| idea-synthesis | Synthesize diverse ideas into coherent solution concepts. Combines fragments from multiple ideation passes into structured, actionable ideas with clear mechanism descriptions. |
| parameter-identification | Identify the key parameters/dimensions of a problem space. Produces a structured parameter list with value ranges for morphological analysis. |
