## Context Management

- Each strategy tracks its own budget via State Ledger
- Strategies MUST NOT exceed allocated budget
- Campaign monitors cumulative spend across all strategies
- If a strategy exhausts budget before meeting yield, escalate to campaign level for reallocation
- Prefer paper-overview over paper-research for initial exploration (lower cost)
- Emergent properties are the primary campaign-level quality metric

| Tactic | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| blend-construction | Construct complete 4-space blends with emergent structure. Orchestrates input-space-construction → generic-space-extraction → blend-composition. |
| creative-ideation-combination-mapping | Systematically enumerate parameter dimensions and generate viable combinations. Orchestrates parameter extraction → value enumeration → compatibility assessment → synthesis. |
| emergence-detection | Detect and validate emergent properties from combinations. Orchestrates emergent-property-identification → blend-elaboration. |
| evaluation-filtering | Multi-dimensional evaluation and tiered filtering of generated ideas. Orchestrates novelty assessment → feasibility check → ranking → selection. |

## Available SOPs

可选,无固定顺序;最终叶子终为 sop。

| SOP | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| abstraction-ladder | Perform bisociation at multiple abstraction levels |
| blend-completion | Complete blend with background knowledge |
| blend-composition | Compose new connections in blended space |
| blend-elaboration | Run blend as mental simulation |
| combinatorial-synthesis | Synthesize all combinatorial creativity outputs |
| context-checkpoint | Append research process and results to the current Phase's context file. Each append MUST contain >=500 lines of markdown covering both process and results. Use this skill at plan-designated checkpoint points — typically after each strategy completes or at key decision nodes within a research Phase. |
| context-init | Create a new context file for a research Phase. Called once at Phase start to initialize the file that subsequent context-checkpoint calls will append to. Use this skill whenever a new research Phase begins and a fresh context file is needed. |
| creative-ideation-novelty-scoring | Score ideas on novelty dimensions — structural distance from known solutions, conceptual surprise, domain-crossing depth. Produces ranked novelty assessment. |
| creative-ideation-saturation-detection | Determine when additional ideation yields diminishing returns. Analyzes latest idea batch against existing corpus to judge continue/near-saturation/saturated. |
| domain-scanning | Scan distant domains for transferable principles. Uses web-search and paper-overview to identify analogous solutions in unrelated fields. |
| emergent-property-identification | Identify non-additive properties from combinations |
| function-redistribution | Redistribute functions across different components |
| generic-space-extraction | Extract shared abstract structure from two input spaces |
| idea-synthesis | Synthesize diverse ideas into coherent solution concepts. Combines fragments from multiple ideation passes into structured, actionable ideas with clear mechanism descriptions. |
| input-space-construction | Build input spaces for two source concepts |
| parameter-identification | Identify the key parameters/dimensions of a problem space. Produces a structured parameter list with value ranges for morphological analysis. |
| vital-relation-mapping | Map 15 vital relations between concepts |
