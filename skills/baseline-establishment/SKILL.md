# Baseline Establishment

## Strategy Routing

| User Intent | Route To |
|-------------|----------|
| Find all methods for a task | method-inventory |
| Extract scores from papers | performance-extraction |
| Normalize conditions across papers | condition-standardization |
| Check reproducibility / discrepancies | discrepancy-analysis |
| Track progress over time / headroom | progress-quantification |

## Manifest

### Strategies (5)

| Strategy | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| method-inventory | Comprehensively identify all relevant methods for a task |
| performance-extraction | Systematically extract performance data and conditions from papers |
| condition-standardization | Standardize evaluation condition differences across papers |
| discrepancy-analysis | Identify discrepancies between reported and reproducible scores |
| progress-quantification | Track performance progress over time, quantify remaining headroom |

### Tactics (3)

| Tactic | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| leaderboard-harvesting | Systematically collect performance data from platforms and papers |
| condition-normalization | Compare and standardize experimental conditions across papers |
| progress-curve-construction | Build performance-over-time progress curves |

### Subagent SOPs (10)

| SOP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| method-discovery | Identify methods via literature, leaderboards, citation chains |
| score-extraction | Extract (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score, Conditions) tuples |
| condition-cataloging | Record evaluation conditions per method |
| reproducibility-checklist-audit | Assess paper against ML Reproducibility Checklist |
| performance-table-assembly | Assemble unified comparison table |
| compute-normalization | Normalize results by compute budget |
| discrepancy-identification | Compare same-method scores across sources |
| headroom-estimation | Estimate ceiling vs current SOTA gap |
| progress-curve-fitting | Construct performance-over-time data |
| baseline-synthesis | Produce final structured baseline report |

## Context Management

Campaign outputs are accumulated in the calling knowledge-acquisition context:

- `methods_inventory.json` — All discovered methods with metadata
- `performance_data.json` — Extracted scores with provenance
- `conditions_matrix.json` — Standardized conditions per method
- `discrepancy_report.json` — Flagged score inconsistencies
- `progress_curves.json` — Time-series performance data
- `baseline_report.md` — Final synthesized baseline document

## Available Strategies

可选,无固定顺序;最终叶子终为 sop。

| Strategy | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| condition-standardization | Standardize evaluation condition differences across papers — 20 methods, 60 data points, 30 web searches budget |
| discrepancy-analysis | Identify discrepancies between reported and reproducible scores — 15 methods, 45 data points, 30 web searches budget |
| method-inventory | Comprehensively identify all relevant methods for a task — 50 methods, 60 web searches budget |
| performance-extraction | Systematically extract performance data and conditions from papers — 30 methods, 150 data points, 40 web searches budget |
| progress-quantification | Track performance progress over time, quantify remaining headroom — 30 methods, 100 data points, 40 web searches budget |

## Available SOPs

可选,无固定顺序;最终叶子终为 sop。

| SOP | 何时用 |
| --- | --- |
| context-checkpoint | Append research process and results to the current Phase's context file. Each append MUST contain >=500 lines of markdown covering both process and results. Use this skill at plan-designated checkpoint points — typically after each strategy completes or at key decision nodes within a research Phase. |
| context-init | Create a new context file for a research Phase. Called once at Phase start to initialize the file that subsequent context-checkpoint calls will append to. Use this skill whenever a new research Phase begins and a fresh context file is needed. |
