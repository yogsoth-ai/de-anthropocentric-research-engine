## Context Management

- Each strategy tracks its own budget via State Ledger
- Strategies MUST NOT exceed allocated budget
- Campaign monitors cumulative spend across all strategies
- If a strategy exhausts budget before meeting yield, escalate to campaign level for reallocation
- Prefer paper-overview over paper-research for initial exploration (lower cost)
- Perspective diversity is a campaign-level constraint: strategies should not overlap viewpoints

## Available Tactics

| Tactic | Role |
|--------|------|
| evaluation-filtering | Filter and rank ideas by novelty and feasibility (shared) |

## Available SOPs

| SOP | Role |
|-----|------|

## Available Strategies

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| Strategy | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| constraint-driven-ideation | Inject extreme constraints to force innovation — impossibility breeds creativity. |
| role-based-ideation | Role-play as reviewer/practitioner/theorist/novice/competitor to generate diverse perspectives on a solution. |
| six-hats-rotation | Complete Six Hats rotation (White→Red→Black→Yellow→Green→Blue) to force systematic perspective diversity. |
| stakeholder-simulation | Simulate user/engineer/investor/regulator/society perspectives to surface hidden requirements and opportunities. |
| temporal-projection | View problem from 5yr/50yr/500yr future, backcast to generate temporally-informed creative solutions. |

## Available Tactics

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| Tactic | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| constraint-protocol | Inject constraints → force creative response → extract transferable principles. Orchestrates constraint injection, response generation, and principle extraction. |
| creative-ideation-perspective-rotation | Rotate through reviewer/practitioner/theorist/time-machine/novice perspectives systematically. Ensures comprehensive viewpoint coverage. |
| creative-ideation-provocation-generation | Generate PO provocations and extract constructive movement. Orchestrates assumption surfacing → provocation creation → movement extraction → idea formation. |
| evaluation-filtering | Multi-dimensional evaluation and tiered filtering of generated ideas. Orchestrates novelty assessment → feasibility check → ranking → selection. |

## Available SOPs

Optional, no fixed order; the final leaf is always a sop.

| SOP | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| competitor-simulation | Competitor perspective — design strategies to defeat this solution, then use attack vectors to improve it. |
| constraint-injection | Inject artificial constraints to force creative divergence. Generates and applies constraints (resource, time, material, audience, scale) to existing ideas to produce variants. |
| constraint-response | Generate creative solutions under extreme constraints — no "impossible" allowed, find a way. |
| context-checkpoint | Append research process and results to the current Phase's context file. Each append MUST contain >=500 lines of markdown covering both process and results. Use this skill at plan-designated checkpoint points — typically after each strategy completes or at key decision nodes within a research Phase. |
| context-init | Create a new context file for a research Phase. Called once at Phase start to initialize the file that subsequent context-checkpoint calls will append to. Use this skill whenever a new research Phase begins and a fresh context file is needed. |
| creative-ideation-assumption-surfacing | Enumerate implicit assumptions in a problem statement or existing solution. Produces categorized assumption inventory (physical, social, temporal, economic, technical). |
| creative-ideation-novelty-scoring | Score ideas on novelty dimensions — structural distance from known solutions, conceptual surprise, domain-crossing depth. Produces ranked novelty assessment. |
| creative-ideation-saturation-detection | Determine when additional ideation yields diminishing returns. Analyzes latest idea batch against existing corpus to judge continue/near-saturation/saturated. |
| idea-synthesis | Synthesize diverse ideas into coherent solution concepts. Combines fragments from multiple ideation passes into structured, actionable ideas with clear mechanism descriptions. |
| novice-perspective | Novice perspective — question the 'obvious' by adopting deliberate ignorance to reveal hidden complexity. |
| perspective-synthesis | Synthesize all perspective outputs into a structured multi-perspective idea report. |
| po-provocation | Generate PO (Provocative Operation) statements per de Bono's lateral thinking. Creates deliberately illogical provocations to escape dominant thinking patterns. |
| practitioner-hat | Engineer perspective — assess buildability, cost, timeline, and integration challenges. |
| reviewer2-hat | Hostile reviewer perspective — find fatal flaws, logical gaps, and missing evidence in a solution. |
| theorist-hat | Theorist perspective — assess theoretical foundations, formal rigor, and formalization opportunities. |
| time-machine | Temporal projection — view a solution from future/past time horizons to generate temporally-informed insights. |
